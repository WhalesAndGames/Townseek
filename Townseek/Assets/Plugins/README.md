## **The following Asset Store plugins were used for developing _Townseek_:**

### Mandatory

These must be included in the project's *Plugins* folder in order for the project's *Source* to compile!

### Audio Middleware

The audio in our game does not use Unity's built-in audio, and instead uses FMod as audio middleware.
