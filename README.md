# Townseek

Born undersea, but with an appetite to soar the skies and explore the world! Now that you've got yourself a reliable airship, it's time to make those dreams come true! Travel far and wide, charting down the exotic locations that the globe has to offer. Meet the locals from towns far away from each other. Engage in the old tradition of exchanging goods for money. The entire world is your new sea, and be sure to see all what it has to offer!

**Unity Version Used 2020.2.2f1**
